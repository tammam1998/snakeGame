# Snake Game in C++
<h1>This game was made using Visual Studio 2017</h1>
<h2>I used this youtube tutorial to make this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-lMZDi7Uw&t=1s</h2>
<ul><h2>Changes I made:</h2>
  <li>I added Bombs in the game and made them increase as the snake grows.</li>
  <li>I made the snake speed up as it grows.</li>
  <li>I made the game able to store your username so you can get your last high score back.</li>
  <li>I added the ability to restart the game without closing and reopening it.</li>
  <li>I added the ability to change user inside the game.</li>
  <li>I fixed some bug such as the snake death if you press the opposite side of your current movement because the snake touchs its tail.</li>
  </ul>
