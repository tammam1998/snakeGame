# snakeGame in c++
This game was made using visual studio 2017
I used this youtube tutorial to make this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_-lMZDi7Uw&t=1s
Changes I made:
  I added Bombs in the game and made them increase as the snake grows.
  I made the snake speed up as it grows.
  I made the game able to store your username so you can get your last high score back.
  I added the ability to restart the game without closing and reopening it.
  I added the ability to change user inside the game.
  I fixed the bug that the snake dies if you press the opposite side of your current movement because snake touchs its tail.
